# InfuseFlow public roadmap

View the [official InfuseFlow product roadmap](https://github.com/users/infuseflow/projects/3/views/1).

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they are in, and when we expect to make them available.  

The roadmap repository is for communicating InfuseFlow's development roadmap.  Currently, all issues are read-only, and we are locking conversations as we get started. Interaction limits are also in place to encure that issues originate from InfuseFlow. We're planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself, and we see potential to engage more in discussions about the future of InfuseFlow products and features.  If you have feedback about the structure of the roadmap, please send us an email.  We'd be happy to hear from you.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with one or more colored labels indicating the following:

- A **platform** that describes the product/platform the issue is applicable to.  See below for the list of current platforms.
- A **release phase** that describes the current development readiness stage that the issue is in. See below for the list of release phases.
- A **roadmap phase** that describes the anticipated release timing for the issue.  See below for the list of current roadmap phases.
- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the issue belongs.  See below for a list of current feature areas.
- Once an issue has been made production ready, the **GA** status label will be applied and the issue will be closed.

## Platforms

Platforms describe the major product family that the issue belongs to, and consist of any of the following:

- **Enterprise**: the InfuseFlow product offering in all associated licensing forms applicable for the InfuseFlow Enterprise customer
- **Professional**: the hosted InfuseFlow product offering applicable for the InfuseFlow Profesisonal customer

## Release Phases

Release phases generally describe the status of an issue in terms of product readiness, from design, through development, through testing and general availability.

- **exploring**: *Feature is under consideration, gathering feedback and estimating complexity.*

  

- **design**: *The solution to the issue is being actively designed and specifications for development are being written.*

  

- **development**: *The solution to the issue is being actively constructed by the development team.*

  

- **qa**: *The solution to the issue is being tested by quality assurance for specification conformity.*

  Internal only, not available for external review or feedback.

  

- **alpha**: *The solution to the issue is made available for early evaluation and testing.*

  Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement and coordination.  Features are still under heavy development and subject to significant change, including complete de-scoping from the final release.  Not for production use, no training, SLAs or support provided.

  

- **beta**: *The solution to the issue is generally complete and available for final testing.*

  Limited availability, requires beta-release agreement and coordination.  Features are primarily complete, although may still see some final revisions prior to final release.  Limited training provided, limited to pre-production use.  No SLAs or support provided.

  

- **ga**: *The solution is complete and is generally available in a numbered version of the software.*

  Open to all customers.  Ready for production use with full support, training and SLAs available.  Typically 1-2 quarters following Beta.

## Roadmap Phase

Roadmap planning is broken down into successive phases, with each phase correlating roughly with one calendar quarter.

Issues are considered from the backlog, and then prioritized, estimated, and assigned to a roadmap phases, for anticipated release timing.  Until an issue reaches the **Beta** release phase, it may be moved, removed or redesigned from in any future roadmap phase.  Roadmap phase planning is offered only to provide general insight and visibility into InfuseFlow development priorities and direction, and should not be considered as a commitment to deliver any planned issue with exact timing.

Once a release enters the Beta phase, feature lists and release timing will be made available for external planning purposes.  Until then, all issues and plans are subject to change.

- **Backlog**: the backlog is the complete list of unplanned, undeveloped work being considered
- **Phase N:** the current numbered (N) development phase
- **Phase N+1**: the immediate next development phase (N+1)

Each development Phase is intended to consist of approximately:

1. 3 months of design and development
2. 3 months of internal and external testing
3. General Availability

Some development items may require more than one phase of work to complete, and so for those items, our roadmap always displays the next two development phases, so that longer lead items can be planned to extend over the lifetime of two phases.

## Feature Areas

The following is the list of our current feature areas:

- **ui/ux**: User experience, basic navigation, patterns, interactions, etc
- **security**: Login, data security, auditing, access control, etc
